flickrtxt
=========

A jQuery plugin that replaces text with randomly selected images from the Flickr letters collection, and then makes them flicker (if you want them to).

Sample usage:

```
$('.flick-me').flickrtxt({ flickrFreq: 1})
```

where flickrFreq is the speed in Hz at which letters are randomly replaced.

See it in action at http://flickrtxt.adam-butler.com.
